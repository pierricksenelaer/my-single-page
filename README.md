# Single webpage

### ABOUT ###

* This static webpage was made up using HTML5 markup and the Bootstrap 4 components library

* Tech stack:
    * `Bootstrap 4`(using the SCSS version)
    * `SCSS` overrides & customisations where necessary (that compiled into CSS)
    * `Gulp` as the task runner (e.g JS and SCSS compiling)
    * `HTML5` as the markup
    * `Nothing else` No third party plugins were used beyond using the Bootstrap 4 framework
